# Fractal Unity Starter Kit

Fractal Unity SDK is designed to get your Unity project up and running with Fractal services in a few easy steps. The package provides all the Client APIs for interacting with the user's wallet.

## Requirements

Fractal SDK always targets the latest LTS version of Unity (Currently 2021.3.18f1). We recommend you use the LTS version of Unity to build projects that are in production or about to ship. However, you should not encounter any issues when integrating or migrating into any other versions of Unity above the targeted LTS release.

## Example
